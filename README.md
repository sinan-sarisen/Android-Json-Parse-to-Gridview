Used Technologies:
Volley; 
Volley is an HTTP library that makes networking for Android apps easier and most importantly, faster. Volley is available on GitHub.

Volley offers the following benefits:

Automatic scheduling of network requests.
Multiple concurrent network connections.
Transparent disk and memory response caching with standard HTTP cache coherence.
Support for request prioritization.
Cancellation request API. You can cancel a single request, or you can set blocks or scopes of requests to cancel.
Ease of customization, for example, for retry and backoff.
Strong ordering that makes it easy to correctly populate your UI with data fetched asynchronously from the network.
Debugging and tracing tools.

Picasso;
Images add much-needed context and visual flair to Android applications. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your applicationâ€”often in one line of code!

Picasso.get().load("http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png").into(imageView);
Many common pitfalls of image loading on Android are handled automatically by Picasso:

Handling ImageView recycling and download cancelation in an adapter.
Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.
Automatic memory and disk caching.
